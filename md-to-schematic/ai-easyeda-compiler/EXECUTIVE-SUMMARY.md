   - Extracts from datasheets & HTML
   - Learns electrical limits, warnings, thermal
   - Auto-generates design rules
   - Command: `npm run harvest`

2. **Learning Engine** (600 lines)
   - Evaluates quality (0-100, A-D)
   - Tracks trends & failures
   - Auto-generates improvements
   - Command: `npm run learn`

3. **Auto PCB Designer** (370 lines, optimized)
   - Monitors inputs/ (1 min intervals)
   - Applies learned knowledge
   - Generates schematics + BOMs + pins
   - Command: `npm run auto:fast`

4. **EasyEDA Integration**
   - Converts to native formats
   - Manufacturing export
   - Command: `npm run integrate`
